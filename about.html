   <!-- <h2 style="background-color: green;">  When did you start your company?</h2>  

<h3> I opened my first outlet in Sector-9, Chandigarh, in January 2011. It was the first ‘pizza booth’ in Tricity offering giant slices and giant pizzas. Now, there are about 150 La Pino’z outlets in almost every state of India.</h3>

<h2 style="background-color: green;">What prompted you to do it?</h2>

<h3>I was working in an IT company, but I felt there was something missing. I left my job and decided to start something on my own in the IT sector. Because of the financial crunch, I couldn’t do so. Also, I felt that there was always a chef inside me. Both, my drive to be an entrepreneur and my love for food pushed me to start ‘La Pino’z’</h3>

<h2 style="background-color: green;">How did you educate yourself for this work ?</h2>

<h3>Luckily, I had many chefs around. My frequent visits to the United States played a big role as it helped me acquire a good taste in food. We created products according to my palate.
 <!-- I were learning while moving forward. Technology, inventions, and new creations were implemented throughout our business and that’s how we flourished.</h3> -->

<h3>The story of your favorite pizza place started back in 2011 when Sanam Kapoor opened his very first pizzeria in his hometown Chandigarh. Inspired by his own search for delicious pizza options, he started to wonder if there was a better way of doing pizza – and business. The last thing the world needed was another pizzeria, but maybe this one could be different. Maybe with this one, everyone could get exactly what they wanted, made fresh on demand. It all started sounding pretty great, and soon Sanam was opening the first La Pinoz in City Beautiful.
